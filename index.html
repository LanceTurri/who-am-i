You've found the source code! You probably thought, "Oh I'm not going to click on all of these things, I'll just read everything in source". Well, I certainly can't stop you from doing that, but I will say, if you haven't yet, I would encourage you to go through the experience of having the story unfold.

Hint:
Control + ~ will pull up a menu with various functions you can have fun with.

		Hello, my name is <em class="underline" data-bind="click: revealText.bind($data, '1', '')">Lance
		<span class="hidden highlight" data-segment="1">Steven</span>
		Turri</em> and I am <em data-bind="click: revealText.bind($data, '2', '')">a</em>
		<span class="hidden highlight" data-segment="2">super hero</span>
		<em data-bind="click: revealText.bind($data, '3', '')">front end developer</em>

		<span class="hidden highlight" data-segment="3">and scrum master. Some of my interests include
			<em data-bind="click: revealText.bind($data, '4', '')">reading</em><span class="hidden highlight" data-segment="4"> (I'm a philosophy major)</span>, watching rugby, and writing<em data-bind="click: revealText.bind($data, '5', '')"> scalable css</em>.

					<span class="hidden highlight" data-segment="5">
						I love having a design in front of me and finding the best, most efficient way of making it come to
						<em data-bind="click: revealText.bind($data, '6', '')">life</em>
						<span class="hidden highlight" data-segment="6"> because at heart I am a
							<em data-bind="click: revealText.bind($data, '7', '')">puzzle</em> solver.
							<span class="hidden highlight" data-segment="7"> Ever since I was a kid I wanted to solve everything. Taking a remote apart, the month I spent when I first got a rubiks cube, the myriad of gameboy games that had a strong puzzle component.</span>
						</span>
						That is what I love most about front end work; I can bring my imagination and my desire to create something together. Front end development is like a constant puzzle that changes daily and I love solving it, this is certainly my <em data-bind="click: revealText.bind($data, '8', '')">passion</em>.
					</span>

					<span class="hidden highlight" data-segment="8">Whew! I'm surprised you're still reading! Okay what do you want to know?

				<div>
					<em data-bind="click: revealText.bind($data, '9', '')">Your CSS</em>
					<section class="hidden highlight" data-segment="9">Alright! Let's talk about CSS. I LOVE writing <em data-bind="click: revealText.bind($data, '10', '')">CSS</em>.

						<p class="hidden highlight" data-segment="10">My HTML and CSS writing philosophy (if you can call it that) is very simple, write as <em data-bind="click: revealText.bind($data, '11', '')">little as possible</em>.</span> <span class="hidden highlight" data-segment="11">Of course I subscribe to the DRY principle and the idea of OOCSS, but how my code actually turns out is always dependant on the project and what its <em data-bind="click: revealText.bind($data, '12', '')">needs</em> are.</span> <span class="hidden highlight" data-segment="12">The problem comes in that scalable CSS takes different forms depending on what you are trying to do and what scales for the <em data-bind="click: revealText.bind($data, '13', '')">company</em> and product you are a part of.</span> <span class="hidden highlight" data-segment="13">For instance, writing CSS when you are the only front end <i>guy</i> is quite different than having a team of <em data-bind="click: revealText.bind($data, '14', '')">font loving</em><span class="hidden highlight" data-segment="14"> (My favorite is Avenir)</span>, pixel perfect counterparts.</span></p>

						<p class="hidden highlight" data-segment="10">At the end of the day, I want to write as clear and <em data-bind="click: revealText.bind($data, '15', '')">concise</em> of front end code as possible. <span class="hidden highlight" data-segment="15">Someone reading what I've worked on should never have to ask me how it works, or why I <em data-bind="click: revealText.bind($data, '16', '')">did it that way</em><span class="hidden highlight" data-segment="16"> (that's what comments are for!)</span>.</span></p>

						<a href="#">How about some Pens?</a>
					</section>

					<em data-bind="click: revealText.bind($data, '17', '')">Your Favorite movies</em>

					<section class="hidden highlight" data-segment="17">
						Well, I'm not entirely sure why you are so interested, but since you clicked, here are my top three.

						<ul>
							<li>Pulp Fiction</li>
							<li>The Princess Bride</li>
							<li>Howl's Moving Castle</li>
						</ul>
					</section>

					<em data-bind="click: revealText.bind($data, '18', '')">Some books that I would recommend</em>

					<section class="hidden highlight" data-segment="18">
						I am certainly more of a Sci-Fi and Fantasy fan but there are a few in here that would appeal to other genres.

						<ul>
							<li>The Expanse (On book 5 of 9)</li>
							<li>Mistborn trilogy</li>
							<li>Millennium trilogy (The girl with the dragon tattoo)</li>
							<li>Moon is a harsh mistress</li>
							<li>Serena</li>

					<em data-bind="click: revealText.bind($data, '19', '')">Your most complex problem</em>

					<section>
						<p class="hidden highlight" data-segment="19">This is going to sound like a bit of a copout... but the most complex problem I've faced is writing <em data-bind="click: revealText.bind($data, '20', '')">scalable CSS</em>. <span class="hidden highlight" data-segment="20">My definition of this is creating a structure that is both welcoming for developers and able to scale <em data-bind="click: revealText.bind($data, '21', '')">gracefully</em> with new modules, widgets, features, and designs.</span> <span class="hidden highlight" data-segment="21">And therein lies the challenge, to create something that is brilliantly concise and can <em data-bind="click: revealText.bind($data, '22', '')">grow at a whim</em> into any number of things.</span> <span class="hidden highlight" data-segment="22">The way that I do that is by thinking about the <em data-bind="click: revealText.bind($data, '23', '')">individual parts</em> instead of the whole when I am writing code.</span></p>

						<p class="hidden highlight" data-segment="23">As a kid I used to build with Lego's every night. I would stay up till <em data-bind="click: revealText.bind($data, '24', '')">three in the morning</em><span class="hidden highlight" data-segment="24"> (back when cartoon network went to static after Space Ghost)</span>, building everything I possibly could. When I would do this, I never thought I need a spaceship, I would say I need a 2 x 4 that is red to <em data-bind="click: revealText.bind($data, '25', '')">build this section</em>. <span class="hidden highlight" data-segment="25">That's what CSS should do, building reusable, dynamic, agnostic blocks that can be combined to build <em data-bind="click: revealText.bind($data, '26', '')">anything</em>.</span> <span class="hidden highlight" data-segment="26">And when you just have to have that trapdoor so that the evil wizard can be <em data-bind="click: revealText.bind($data, '27', '')">defeated</em>, you can create a new class.</span></p>

						<p class="hidden highlight" data-segment="27">You made it! Congratulations! I honestly didn't think anyone would read all of this, but you have proved me wrong.</p>
